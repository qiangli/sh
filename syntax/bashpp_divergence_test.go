// THE PUBLISHED DIVERGENCE ALLOWLIST — the executable form of the Bash++
// compatibility contract.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. TestBashPPMatchesBash used to demand byte-identical
// ASTs between LangBash and LangBashPP across the whole parser corpus. That
// assertion was true only while the command-position dispatch was absent, and
// the dispatch breaks it BY DESIGN — at the published Class E sites and nowhere
// else. Weakening or deleting the test would throw away the one gate that can
// tell a designed divergence from a regression, so instead the claim is
// re-expressed: identical everywhere EXCEPT at published Class E rows, each
// divergence named and traceable to a table row, and a divergence not in the
// table is a FAILURE.
//
// THE THREE RULES the re-expressed gate enforces, in TestBashPPMatchesBash:
//
//  1. NEVER LOSE. If LangBash parses an input, LangBashPP must parse it too.
//     Bash++ is a superset; it may never reject a script bash accepts,
//     whatever the class.
//  2. MEANING PRESERVED, OR NAMED. If LangBash parses an input, the two ASTs,
//     node positions and printed bytes must be identical UNLESS a published
//     Class E row licenses the divergence at a real bash command position.
//     An unlicensed difference fails.
//  3. ADDITIVE ONLY. If LangBash rejects an input, LangBashPP may accept it —
//     that is Class R ground, which by definition no working script occupies —
//     but the acceptance must still be attributable to a recognized start
//     site, so that a parser bug cannot hide as "purely additive".
//
// WHY CLASS E IS THE ONLY LICENSE. The class is the measured answer to "what
// does stock bash 5.3 do with this shape". Class R means bash REJECTS it, so
// claiming the shape takes nothing away from anyone and needs no row. Class E
// means bash ACCEPTS it, so claiming it changes what an existing script does —
// which is exactly the thing that has to be published, escapable and, here,
// enumerated.
//
// TRACEABILITY, AND WHAT THIS TABLE MAY NOT DO. The design of record is
// explicit that a Go test may NOT assert a shape's class: that is the corpus's
// job, and a second source of truth can drift. So no row below measures
// anything. Each row CITES a corpusID, and the chain is:
//
//	bashppAllowedDivergences  (this file: which rows license divergence)
//	  -> day1Cases            (bashpp_startsites_test.go: id -> site, class)
//	    -> baseline.tsv       (verify-day1-table.sh: id -> measured class)
//	      -> GNU bash 5.3.15  (classify.sh: bash -n, the oracle)
//
// TestBashPPDivergenceTableTraceable walks the first link and fails if a row
// cites an id day1Cases does not carry, disagrees with it about the site, or
// cites a row that is not Class E. verify-day1-table.sh walks the second. So
// re-measuring the corpus and getting a different class breaks the build
// rather than quietly relicensing a divergence.

// bashppDivergenceRow is one published Class E row at which LangBashPP is
// permitted to parse differently from LangBash.
type bashppDivergenceRow struct {
	// corpusID names the row in bashpp-tests/tools/startsites/shapes.tsv, via
	// the day1Cases table in bashpp_startsites_test.go. It is the whole point
	// of the row: an allowed divergence that cannot be named is not allowed.
	corpusID string

	// shape is the shape as the design of record spells it, and as day1Cases
	// records it — the two are checked equal. It is a REPRESENTATIVE of the
	// shape rather than the only string the row covers: what the row licenses
	// is whatever the parser makes of this text, so `var x = 1` licenses
	// `var counter = 42` (the same shape, a different name and value) and does
	// not license `var x = "a b"` (a different shape). See bashppAttribute and
	// bashppDeclShape. It also drives the escape check.
	shape string

	// site is the start site the shape opens. Cross-checked against day1Cases.
	site StartSite

	// why records what stock bash 5.3 does with the shape today — the reason
	// the row is Class E and therefore needs licensing at all. It is prose for
	// the reader of a failure message, not an assertion.

// today, so they need no row, no escape and no license. They are reached by
// rule 3 instead.
//
// StartGoIf is also absent, and its absence is load-bearing. `if err != nil {`
// measures Class E, but its commit point needs an unbounded scan to the
// matching brace, so it is an open design question rather than scheduled work.

// "does this text start like the row"; the question that matters is "is this
// the shape the row was measured for".

//
//   - every accepted declaration is named by a published Class E row, so

//   - a Go reserved word where a name belongs. `var if = 1`, `var type = 1`

//     have the supported ARITY and nothing else, which is precisely what an
//     arity check cannot see.
//
// Claiming any of them changes what a working script does at a site bash
// accepts today, which is the one outcome Class E forbids. The assertion here
