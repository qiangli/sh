// This file is the Bash++ start-site DECISION TABLE, extracted from the parser
// rather than embedded in it.
//
// What it is: the predicate the command-position dispatch consults to decide
// whether a Go region opens here. Keeping it separate is not tidiness. It makes
// the decision unit-testable against the measured corpus in
// bashpp-tests/tools/startsites WITHOUT a parser, and it keeps the edit to
// certification-owned parser.go down to the dispatch calls that ask it.
//
// What it is NOT: the dispatch itself. RecognizeStartSite answers "does a Go
// region open here"; whether a particular body is one Bash++ supports is a
// SECOND question, decided where the completed command is reclassified — see
// bashppUntypedDecl/bashppTypeDecl in bashpp_decl.go, bashppShortDecl in
// bashpp_short.go, and bashppFuncForm/bashppDeferForm in bashpp_func.go, each
// of which consults this table and then applies its own body gate. Because the
// P1 sites are now wired, LangBashPP diverges from LangBash exactly at the
// published Class E rows and nowhere else (TestBashPPMatchesBash).
//
// THE BOUNDED-LOOKAHEAD PROPERTY, and why it is load-bearing.
//
// sh's parser is streaming and non-backtracking: it reads the input in chunks
// and cannot rewind. An earlier attempt to fix an unrelated defect by scanning
// ahead for a matching bracket failed three times for exactly this reason —
// the scan ran off the end of the buffered chunk, and the conservative answer
// at a chunk boundary silently restored the old behaviour, which is the worst
// possible failure because it looks like success.
//
// So every recognizer below is required to decide within maxLookahead bytes of
// the command position, and a test asserts it. A site that cannot is not
// "harder to implement" — it is UNIMPLEMENTABLE in this parser without a
// different mechanism, and must be identified now rather than discovered at
// the third failed attempt.
//
// StartGoIf is the known exception and is deliberately excluded from the
// bounded set: a shell `if` may legally carry `{` as the last word of its
// condition and continue with `then`, so only the absence of `then` after the
// MATCHING brace commits. That is unbounded by construction. It is recorded
// here as owed design work, not scheduled as ordinary implementation.

// maxLookahead is the byte budget a start-site recognizer may examine past the
// command position. It is deliberately small: the whole point is that the
// decision fits comfortably inside one buffered chunk.
const maxLookahead = 64

// StartSiteMatch is the verdict for one command position.
type StartSiteMatch struct {
	Site  StartSite
	Class SiteClass

	// Bounded reports whether the verdict was reached inside maxLookahead.
	// A false here on a supposedly-bounded site is a bug in the table, not a
	// property of the input, and the test suite treats it as one.
	Bounded bool

// that a recognizer which falls through cannot accidentally claim a shape.

// which the caller supplies as the source text from the command position.

// shape must keep running as the shell command it is today, and a Class R
// shape is a bash syntax error either way.
//
// The caller must not treat a match as permission to parse: the shell escapes
// (`command var …`, `"var" …`) are handled BEFORE this is consulted, because
// they work by making the position not a Bash++ command position at all.
