// THE UNSUPPORTED-BODY REGRESSION, and why it is written before the parser
// dispatch that makes it interesting.
//
// The Day-1 `var`/`const` sites are Class E: `var x = 1` runs today as an
// ordinary command with three arguments. So the dispatch may only claim a
// command once it knows the WHOLE body is a form Bash++ supports. The failure
// this file exists to catch is the parser committing on the PREFIX — seeing
// `var` and an identifier, deciding a Go region has opened, and then finding
// `extra` or `bar` where it wanted a terminator. At that point the tokens are
// spent: a streaming, non-backtracking parser cannot put them back, so the
// only exits are a diagnostic (which breaks a working script — the one
// outcome the design forbids for Class E) or a half-built node.
//
// `var x = 1 extra` and `var x = foo bar` are the two cheapest witnesses. Both
// open exactly like the supported form and neither IS it, so a recognizer that
// answers from the prefix cannot tell them apart from `var x = 1`, while one
// that waits for the full body separates them without effort.
//
// The four configurations are not decoration:
//
//   - PosixMode off/on, because [Parser.posixBehavior] changes parse rules
//     underneath the dispatch, and a fallback that only survives one of them
//     is not a fallback.
//   - a whole-string reader and a ONE-BYTE reader, because the parser is
//     streaming over an [io.Reader] and its buffer boundary is where
//     lookahead-based designs have historically failed — the conservative
//     answer at a chunk boundary silently restores the old behaviour, which
//     looks exactly like success. A one-byte reader puts a chunk boundary
//     between every pair of bytes, so any hidden dependence on "the rest of
//     the shape happens to be buffered" shows up as a diff here.
//
// The assertion is identity with LangBash — same AST, same node positions,
// same printed bytes — which is the only claim that cannot be satisfied by a
// node that merely happens to run the same way.

// bashppReadModes feeds the same source to the parser two ways: in one piece,
// and one byte at a time.
