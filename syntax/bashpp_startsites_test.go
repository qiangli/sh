// The Bash++ start-site decision table, tested against the measured corpus.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT "CLASS" MEANS HERE, because two different questions wear the
// same word and conflating them silently produces a wrong table.
//
// The corpus in bashpp-tests/tools/startsites answers: "what does stock bash
// 5.3 do with this COMPLETE string?" The parser needs a different answer:
// "what does stock bash 5.3 do at this COMMIT POINT?" For a single-line shape
// the two coincide. For a multi-line one they do not, and they diverge in the
// direction that matters:
//
//	if err != nil { echo a }    complete → REJECT → Class R
//	if err != nil {             commit point (+ then…fi) → ACCEPT → Class E
//
// Both measurements are correct and they describe different strings. The
// parser commits at the opening line, so the COMMIT-POINT class is the one it
// must honour — and it is the riskier of the two, because Class E is what
// requires an escape and a fallback. Reading the complete-form class as the
// commit-point class would understate the compatibility risk on exactly the
// constructs where care is most needed.
//
// So the rows below are commit-point rows, and the corpus's prefix-* ids are
// the ones they correspond to.

// TWO GATES, NOT ONE — this test found the distinction by failing.
//
// `type Color enum { Red }` is the Bash# enum syntax, which no phase has
// implemented. It was listed here as unsupported and the recognizer claimed it
// anyway. The recognizer was right: the shape opens at `type`, which IS a
// Day-1 start site, and only the BODY is unsupported. "Does a Go region open
// here" and "is this particular form supported" are separate questions decided
// at separate points, and the unsupported-form case belongs to the second.
//
// This matters beyond the one row. Any construct sharing a start site with a
// supported form cannot be rejected by the recognizer at all, so its fallback
// must be enforced where the body is parsed. A reviewer checking only this
// test would conclude the fallback is covered when it is not.
//
// Case 5: UNSUPPORTED FORM. A Go shape belonging to a phase P1 has not reached
// must return StartNone, so that a Class E shape keeps running as the shell
// command it is today. Emitting a Bash++ diagnostic here would break working
// scripts, which is the one failure mode the whole design forbids.
