// What a second open of one process substitution observes.
//
// Bash on Linux answers the question with /dev/fd/N: `<(cmd)` names one
// pipe the shell holds open, so opening the path again is another handle on
// the same stream and reads whatever is left of it — nothing, once the
// first reader drained it. Its own procsub test pins that: five reads of
// one `<(date)` print 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, and the `[ -e ]` between them is what
// tells a live substitution from a spent one, because the FIFO of a
// finished substitution has been unlinked.
//
// These pin both halves of that on every host. The Windows named pipe is
// covered by procsubst_secondopen_windows_test.go, which is where a second
// open used to fail outright with "All pipe instances are busy".

// runProcSubstScript runs src with a fresh runner and returns its combined
// output. A substitution that never gets read would block forever, so the
// run is bounded.
