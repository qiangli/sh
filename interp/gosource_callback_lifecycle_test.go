//
// Outside-corpus regressions for the general callback lifecycle and policy.
// None of these use a pinned Go-by-Example / Tour fixture: each is a freshly
// authored original program whose behaviour is measured against a real Go build
// of the same bytes (differGoSource) or, for a refusal, against the interpreter
// alone (runGoSourceRunnerError). They pin invariants that hold regardless of
// which callable is exercised, so a lifecycle or policy regression is caught
// without special-casing any fixture identity.

// TestGoSourceCallbackReuseAfterRecoveredPanic pins that a callback whose panic
// fmt recovers leaves the runner clean enough to run the SAME and later
// callbacks again. The existing fmt_panic case runs one recovered panic and
// stops; this one recovers two, interleaved with successful reuses of the very
// type that panicked, so a teardown that corrupted the borrowed caller state
// (saved result/call cells, panic or exit bits) would diverge from native Go.

// leak one call's cells into the next and drift from native Go.
