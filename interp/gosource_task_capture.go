// GoSource lexical capture identity across tasks.
//
// A Bash++ task snapshot deep copies every mutable value reachable from the
// shell environment (see [bashPPObjectCloner]); the parent keeps running
// concurrently, and sharing interpreter heap between the two would be a data
// race. That is the right default for classic Bash++, where `go f()` is a
// shell construct and a task is a private copy of the shell.
//
// It is the wrong default for an ORIGINAL Go program. Go closures capture
// their free variables BY REFERENCE, so a goroutine and its parent name the
// same variable:
//
//	var counter int
//	var mu sync.Mutex
//	for i := 0; i < 8; i++ {
//	    wg.Add(1)
//	    go func() {
//	        mu.Lock()
//	        counter++      // must increment the counter the parent prints
//	        mu.Unlock()
//	        wg.Done()
//	    }()
//	}
//	wg.Wait()
//	fmt.Println(counter)   // 8 in Go; 0 under a deep-copy snapshot
//
// bashpp_task.go already carves out imported native handles, so a
// `sync.Mutex` or `atomic.Int64` names one object across the boundary. But the
// plain interpreted cell the mutex PROTECTS was still deep copied, so a
// correctly synchronized original Go program printed the parent's untouched
// copy. This file closes that gap for GoSource programs only.
//
// # The rule
//
// Identity is granted to exactly the cells a task's closure captures
// lexically, and to nothing else:
//
//   - Only in GoSource mode. Classic Bash++ `go f()` keeps its deep-copy
//     snapshot unchanged; [Runner.bashPPGoSourceTaskCapture] returns nil there
//     and every hook below is a no-op on a nil set.
//   - Only names the body actually USES as variables, computed by the lexical
//     scope walker in this file, and in each original callable descriptor
//     carried into the task. Each descriptor retains its lexical references
//     independently of the variable holding its function value. A name the body
//     re-declares — a `:=`, a `var`, a nested parameter, a range or select
//     binding — is a different variable from the outer one that happens to
//     share a spelling, and the outer cell is NOT shared. Text inside a
//     string literal is not a variable use at all.
//   - Native-handle and channel VARIABLES retain their cell identity after
//     first-admission session or task-group authentication. Each operation
//     still validates the referenced object. Classic snapshots still copy
//     descriptors. A local struct holding native fields is also one original
//     variable; copying it would fork mutable map/slice fields beside them.
//
// # Why precision, not over-approximation
//
// An earlier revision collected every [syntax.Lit] the body mentioned and
// argued that over-approximating was "safe because a superset of the free
// variables still resolves". It is not safe. Sharing is not a no-op on a cell
// the task never touches: it removes the deep copy, so the PARENT's live cell
// is spliced into a concurrently running task's environment, where an alias, a
// pointer target or a captured closure scope can reach and mutate it — for a
// variable the program never asked to share. `fmt.Println("counter")` would
// have shared an unrelated outer `counter`, and a body whose own `x := …`
// shadows an outer `x` would have shared the outer one it can never name. The
// walker below therefore reports EXACTNESS for each body, and an inexact
// analysis shares nothing. A task also carries original callable descriptors;
// each keeps its own exact lexical references, even if this particular task
// never invokes it. This is closure identity, not interpreting a string or a
// shadowed local as an outer use:
//
//   - A construct the walker does not model returns exact=false, and the
//     launch is REFUSED with a diagnostic (see
//     [Runner.bashPPGoSourceCaptureUnsupported]). An earlier revision fell
//     back to the classic deep-copy snapshot here; that is not a conservative
//     fallback for an original Go program but a different program, so the gap
//     is now reported rather than run. Either way the walker never silently
//     aliases a cell the program did not name.
//
// # Race safety
//
// A shared cell is shared exactly as a Go variable is, which makes
// synchronization the program's responsibility, as in Go. That is not a
// loophole in practice: every native `mu.Lock()`, `wg.Wait()` and
// `atomic.Add` is a request that serializes on the dependency session's own
// Go mutexes (see [bashPPNativeSession.request]), so a program which
// synchronizes its shared variable the way Go requires also establishes the
// Go happens-before edges the race detector checks. A program which does NOT
// synchronize races here because it races in Go too — reproducing the
// original's meaning includes reproducing that.

// bashPPGoSourcePin pins the function value a launched task resolved to.
//
// `go f()` where f is a variable holding a closure must name ONE function: the
// value f held when the `go` statement ran. Go evaluates the function value in
// the launching goroutine, and so do we — once, in the parent, before the
// snapshot, so the capture analysis and the task itself agree on which body is
// running and a computed callee such as `go factory()()` is never evaluated a
// second time in the child.
//
// The pin carries the closure HANDLE rather than the parent's *bashPPFunc, so
