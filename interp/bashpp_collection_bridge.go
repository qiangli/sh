// A predeclared call that produces a value — `append(xs, 1)`, `copy(dst, src)`,
// `make([]int, 2)`, `new(T)` — is implemented over bashPPCell rather than as a
// callable, so the scalar evaluator has nothing to look up for it and reports
// "undefined callable append". That stays invisible while the result is bound
// by `xs = append(xs, 1)`, because the statement paths in bashpp_p1.go and
// bashpp_readonly.go dispatch the builtin themselves. It surfaces the moment
// the call appears as an argument to a dependency, which is how the Tour writes
// it: `fmt.Println(append(s[:0], "a"))`, `fmt.Println(copy(dst, src), src)`.
//
// bashPPValueBuiltinBridge runs such a call once, where the bridge needs its
// value, and answers with the crossed value whatever its shape: `append` and
// `make` yield a collection, `copy` an int, `new` a pointer. Running it exactly
// once matters — these calls mutate (`copy` writes into its destination), so a
// hook that probed for a collection and then re-ran for a scalar would copy
// twice.
//
// It claims only the value-producing spellings. `len` and `cap` already have a
// scalar spelling and keep it, along with the diagnostics the scalar path owns,
// and the statement-only forms (`clear`, `delete`, `print`, `println`) have no
// value to bridge. A name the session declared itself is never claimed:
// bashPPPredeclaredCall answers only where nothing of that name was declared,
// so a program's own `func copy(...)` shadows the predeclared one as in Go.
