// The shell process's own CPU — builtins, arithmetic, and in-process
// subshell goroutines (subshells are goroutines, not real forks in this
// pure-Go runner) — is captured separately by sampling the shell process
// CPU (getrusage RUSAGE_SELF on Unix, GetProcessTimes on Windows) before
// and after the clause. Only genuine external children are missed by that
// process-wide delta, so only their ProcessState CPU is folded in here.
//
// A pipeline's children are waited on concurrently (each stage runs on a
// subshell copy of the runner that shares this one scope by pointer), so
// aggregation is mutex-guarded. Nested `time` clauses share the single
// outermost scope, so each child's CPU is added exactly once and inner
// clauses cannot double-count it.
