// launcher installs a signal handler and waits for the child, so a SIGINT or
// SIGTERM delivered to the launcher process alone (not its process group) is
// forwarded to the child, which exits rather than continuing to run after the
// launcher returns. Both the ordinary replay path and the -V=full version-probe
// path route through the same wait helper, so both are exercised.
//
// This asserts only the launcher's direct-child behavior; it establishes
// nothing about any further interpreter-helper grandchildren. The baseline
// launcher (no forwarding) exits on the signal and leaves the child running,
// which the interrupted-marker wait detects as a bounded failure.
