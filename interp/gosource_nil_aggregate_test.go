// Sprint: #118; Story: #56; Story-ID: 3ef468f4e831
//
// Aggregate-element coverage for the nil repair in interp/gosource_nil.go
// (goSourceNilElement / goSourceInterfaceElement) and its two call sites in
// bashPPEvalElement.
//
// Aggregate storage carries (value, meta) rather than a cell, so a nil written
// into a table entry, a struct field or a map value never reaches the
// variable/argument paths that already knew how to build one. Before the
// repair those elements fell through to the scalar path and reported
// BASHPP-EEXPR-NIL, or -- worse for an interface element -- would have had to
// coerce nil to "" to get past it.
//
// Every case here is an authored program, not a forwarded standard-library
// body. Each runs through all three controls: native Go as the oracle, the
// interpreter over the original AST, and the lowered artifact built from
// source that is deleted before it runs.

import "testing"

// TestGoSourceNilAggregateThreeModes pins that an aggregate element keeps the
// dynamic identity of the nil it was given. The distinction Go draws -- an
// untyped nil leaves an interface nil, a typed nil conversion stores a
// non-nil interface holding a nil pointer -- has to survive the trip through
// element storage, which is what goSourceNilElement's interface branch and
// goSourceInterfaceElement's boxing exist for.
func TestGoSourceNilAggregateThreeModes(t *testing.T) {
	cases := map[string]string{
		// The typed half of the initializer shape wrap_test.go's
		// TestAsValidation writes: an []any holding a typed nil pointer, a
		// string and a live pointer. A typed nil conversion must stay a
		// non-nil interface holding a nil *int, and the string element must
		// keep its dynamic type instead of being rejected as a bare scalar,
		// which is goSourceInterfaceElement's boxing. Authored here rather
		// than forwarded.
		//
		// The untyped nil entry the original also carries is pinned by
		// untyped_nil_interface_element_identity below, which was held in
		// gosource_collection_gate_test.go until the read-back repair landed.
