// Sprint: #118; Story: #54; Story-ID: c3a60493cde9
//
// Integration controls for the two sprint118 raw submissions that met here:
// the GoSource lexical task-capture analysis (story #52) and
// `sync.WaitGroup.Go` (story #54).
//
// Each submission was reviewed on its own against a task snapshot that did not
// yet have the other's. Together they make claims neither could measure alone:
// that `wg.Go` uses the SAME capture analysis and the SAME parent-side callee
// pin as `go`, that a launch pins the function value the launching goroutine
// held, that a local binding shadows a package-level `func` of the same name,
// and that a nested launch reaches the counter its grandparent declared.
//
// Everything here is an unchanged, compilable original Go program measured in
// all three modes by captureThreeModes — the Go toolchain, the interpreter and
// the lowered program must agree — so a regression shows up as a different
// number rather than as different metadata.

// TestGoSourceWaitGroupGoSharedLocalCounter is `wg.Go` standing exactly where
// `go func(){…}()` stands in TestGoSourceCaptureNativeMutexSharedLocal.
//
// Before this review, `wg.Go` took the deep-copy snapshot: it called
// bashPPTaskSnapshot with no capture set at all, so the launched body
// incremented a private copy of `counter` and the program printed 0 while
// every WaitGroup control still passed — the counter is not what a WaitGroup
// test looks at. It now goes through the same helper `go` does.

//
// SHADOWING: `work` is bound in main to a closure, and there is also a
// package-level `func work()`. Go resolves the launch to the innermost binding.
// The capture analysis used to consult the declared-func table FIRST, so it
// walked the package-level body — computing a capture set for a function that
// was never launched — while the pin ran the local one.
//
// REASSIGNMENT: `wg.Go(work)` evaluates `work` in the calling goroutine, so the
// first launch runs the closure the variable held THEN, not the one it holds
// when the task is finally scheduled. Resolving the name again inside the task
// would let the second assignment win both launches.
//
// globalRuns is 0 in the answer: it is the witness that the package-level
// `work` never ran.
