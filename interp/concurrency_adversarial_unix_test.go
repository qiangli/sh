// Unix adversarial rows: the ones that need a real kernel-visible carrier
// process or real file descriptors. They register into the same cgCase table as
// the cross-platform rows (concurrency_adversarial_test.go) via init, so there
// is exactly one adversarial table, not two.
//
// Deliberately NO process-wide os signals are raised here. This test binary
// runs many runners concurrently and each installs its own signal.Notify; a
// stray process-directed signal (e.g. an untrapped SIGUSR2 defaulting to
// terminate) would kill the whole binary and destroy every other test's
// diagnosis. Signal delivery is therefore exercised only against a DEDICATED
// carrier child process, whose signals cannot leak to sibling tests. The
// in-process, os-signal path (trapped SIGUSR1 interrupting read) is already
// covered by TestReadInterruptedByTrappedSignal.
