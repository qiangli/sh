// TestBackgroundExternalLaunchBoundary pins the launch boundary of an
// asynchronous external command.
//
// The boundary is the fork, not the child's work. GNU bash makes no part of an
// asynchronous command's effect visible to the next statement — measured 0/20
// on both bash 3.2 and 5.2 for `touch f & [ -e f ]` — so an assertion that the
// marker already exists would claim a guarantee no shell offers, and could only
// ever be bought with a sleep that races under load.
//
// What the shell does guarantee, and what this test asserts, is the pair either
// side of that boundary: the external child really has been launched and named
// by `$!` before the next statement runs, and the parent is not blocked on the
// child finishing.
