// Host synchronization for a cell two interpreted goroutines can both name.
//
// WHY A LOCK EXISTS AT ALL. [bashPPScope] isolates a subshell BY COPY, so no
// lock is needed there. A Go `go` statement is the opposite: the task and its
// launcher must name ONE variable for a package-scope `var` or a captured
// local, so [bashPPCloner.cloneCell] deliberately aliases the cell rather than
// copying it. That makes the cell's fields reachable from two host goroutines.
//
// WHY THE GUEST'S OWN RULES ARE NOT ENOUGH. A Go program that writes such a
// variable from one goroutine while another reads it has a data race, and Go
// leaves the value it reads unspecified — any previously written value is a
// legal answer. What Go does NOT leave unspecified is the HOST: one guest
// `seqno++` is a dozen separate stores into a *bashPPCell, including a string
// header and an interface word. A reader that interleaves with those stores
// can observe a half-updated cell, which is not "some value the program wrote"
// but a torn Go string — undefined behaviour in the interpreter itself, and the
// data race the detector reports against interp rather than against the script.
//
// SO: an aliased cell carries a guard, writers publish their whole field bundle
// under it, and readers take a consistent snapshot under it and then work on
// that snapshot. The guest keeps its unspecified-but-harmless race; the host
// gets a well-defined one of the values that were actually stored. A cell that
// was never aliased has a nil guard and pays nothing.
//
// THE DISCIPLINE. A guarded region moves struct fields and does nothing else.
// It must not evaluate guest code, render a value whose String method could
// re-enter the interpreter, write a diagnostic, or reach for a SECOND cell's
// guard. There is no lock ordering to get wrong because no region ever holds
// two. Where a store needed one of those things — the scalar text in
// [Runner.bashPPWriteUpdatePointer], the whole body of [bashPPStoreCellValue],
// the readonly diagnostics in [Runner.setVar], the right-hand side in
// bashPPForAssign, the interface payload's own value — it is computed first and
// only the stores are bracketed.
//
// WHERE THE GUARD IS TAKEN. Writers: [bashPPCell.publish] (every whole-cell
// rebinding), [bashPPStoreCellValue] (every typed store), [Runner.setVar]
// (a shell assignment writing through a `var` binding),
// [Runner.bashPPWriteUpdatePointer], and the two statement handlers that mutate
// a scalar binding in place. Readers: [bashPPCell.view] and its narrow forms,
// called by every reader that decides among several fields of one value —
// bashPPScalarFromCell, bashPPCellMeta, (*bashPPPointer).read,
// bashPPReadCellValue, bashPPStructuredCell, bashPPDescribeCell,
// bashPPBridgeCell, goSourceUntypedNilCell, lookupVarUnhosted, and every
// private `copyCell := *source`.
//
// WHAT KEEPS THE DISCIPLINE. Two tests in bashpp_cell_share_test.go and
// bashpp_cell_share_scan_test.go hold the two halves of it in place, so that
// neither a new field nor a new reader can slip past by accident:
//
//   - TestBashPPCellFieldsCopied fails when a field is added to [bashPPCell]
//     without being added to [bashPPCell.storeFields] — the one whole-cell
//     store — and pins the single field that store must NOT touch.
//   - TestBashPPCellReadersTakeAView scans package source for a function that
//     reads a looked-up cell's published fields without taking a view. The
//     functions that still do are listed in the test; it is a ratchet, not a
//     clean bill of health.

// shareGuard arms cell for concurrent host access.
//
// It is called only from [bashPPCloner.cloneCell] while it aliases a cell into
// a task snapshot, which always runs in the launching goroutine before that
// task's goroutine starts. The field is therefore written only on a cell's
// FIRST aliasing — when no other goroutine can yet reach it — and is only read
// afterwards.
func (c *bashPPCell) shareGuard() {
	if c != nil && c.guard == nil {

// view returns a cell whose fields a reader may examine without a lock: c
// itself when it was never aliased, otherwise a snapshot taken under the guard.
//
// The snapshot is shallow on purpose. It copies the fields a writer publishes
// as a bundle — the expand.Variable header, the scalar carrier flags, the type
// and identity edges — so no reader sees a torn value. The pointers it copies
// (object identity, collection meta, interface payload) keep their identity, so
// a view is still the same value the cell names.

// publish replaces every field of c with value's, as `*c = *value` did before
// a cell could be shared. It differs from that assignment in two ways, both of
// which the plain assignment gets wrong for a shared cell.
//
// First, it is the whole-cell case of the bundle rule: one struct assignment is
// a couple of dozen host stores, so it is made under c's guard and reads value
// through a snapshot, and no reader can land between the two halves of a
// rebound binding.
//
// Second, it keeps c's OWN guard. The guard answers "is this storage location
// reachable from two goroutines", which is a property of the binding rather
// than of whatever value is currently in it; copying the source's guard field
// over it would silently disarm a shared cell the moment it was reassigned.

// storeFields copies every field of value into c EXCEPT the guard, which is
// the one field a store must leave alone.
//
// A plain `*c = *value` would write the guard word too — with the same pointer
// in it, but a write all the same. Every reader begins by asking whether the
// cell has a guard at all, and that question is asked WITHOUT holding one:
// there is nothing to lock yet. A store that rewrote the word would race with
// exactly the test that decides whether to lock, which is how the guard's own
// field showed up in T4b's race reports as [bashPPCell.view] against
// [bashPPCell.publish]. Leaving the word alone makes it write-once —
// [bashPPCell.shareGuard] sets it before the cell can be reached from a second
// goroutine and nothing writes it again — so an unlocked read of it is sound.
//
// The field list is exhaustive by test: TestBashPPCellFieldsCopied in
// bashpp_cell_share_test.go fails when a field is added to [bashPPCell]
// without being added here.
