// bashPPStackSegmentCalls is how many nested Go-form calls share one host
// goroutine stack.
//
// The evaluator is recursive: every interpreted call level re-enters it on
// the host stack, at several KiB a level, so a Go program that recurses a few
// hundred thousand deep — which a native Go stack carries easily — would
// exceed the host's per-goroutine stack limit long before it ran out of
// memory. Every bashPPStackSegmentCalls levels the next function body
// therefore continues on a fresh host stack while the caller waits, so the
// interpreted depth is bounded by memory, as it is natively, and no single
// host stack grows without limit.
