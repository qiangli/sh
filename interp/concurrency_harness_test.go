// Concurrency gate harness (Sprint #115, sh todo #2, items 4 & 5).
//
// This file is the *machinery* the race gate calls. It deliberately holds no
// test cases of its own — the adversarial ordering table lives in
// concurrency_adversarial_test.go and drives everything here. The design goal
// is that the future Bash++ concurrency story (channels / go / select, tracked
// as 93de714f8c22) EXTENDS this same harness by appending rows to that table,
// rather than standing up a second, divergent harness.
//
// What lives here:
//
//   - cgAwait / cgDeadline: bounded blocking waits. No wait in the harness may
//     hang. On expiry we dump every goroutine stack and fail WITH it, because
//     tripping `go test -timeout` kills the binary and destroys the diagnosis
//     (deliverable 4).
//
//   - cgLeakDetector: goroutine + file-descriptor leak detection that reports a
//     DIAGNOSIS — what leaked and where it was created (the "created by" frame)
//     — not a bare count. The runtime-owned allowlist is a NAMED LIST WITH
//     REASONS, never a numeric threshold, so the next real leak cannot be
//     silently absorbed (deliverable 3).
//
//   - cgQuarantine: the quarantine registry. A quarantined case records owner,
//     rationale and expiry, and is REPORTED as quarantined. A race is never
//     converted into a pass here (deliverable 5).
//
//   - the GOMAXPROCS / repetition matrix lives in concurrency_adversarial_test.go
//     but its bookkeeping type (cgMatrix) is defined here (deliverable 2).
