// Go resolves package-level identifiers over the whole package rather than over
// the text preceding them, so a named type may be used before the line that
// declares it. The interpreter runs declarations as statements in source order,
// which on its own can only look backwards: the Tour's web crawler declares
// `type fakeFetcher map[string]*fakeResult` above `type fakeResult struct{...}`
// and was rejected as `undefined type: fakeResult`.
//
// Registration is therefore split in two. Pass one installs every package-level
// type declaration under its name; pass two is the ordinary statement walk,
// which validates each declaration's representation and binds it where it
// stands. Only the file's own top-level declarations are pre-registered —
// declarations inside function bodies keep their sequential, block-scoped
// treatment, so Go's scoping and shadowing rules are unchanged — and only the
// registry is populated early, so variable initializers still evaluate in
// package initialization order.
