// Bash++ P2 evaluator capability policy.
//
// The design of record makes this a PRECONDITION of choosing an evaluator, not
// a consequence of it: "decide the fallback for cgo, compiled-only and
// unsupported-feature packages before an evaluator is selected, or the choice
// is made by whatever the prototype happened to run."  This file is that
// decision, expressed as code so it is executable rather than prose.  The
// narrative record, including the measured evidence that retired the Yaegi
// time-box, is docs/bashpp-p2-evaluator-decision.md.
//
// TWO RULES GOVERN EVERYTHING BELOW.
//
//  1. FAIL CLOSED.  An unclassified package is refused, never executed.  The
//     zero value of [bashPPCapability] is capUnknown and its policy is
//     policyRefuse, so a class someone forgets to wire up declines to run
//     instead of quietly reaching the toolchain.
//
//  2. ONE REVIEWED ENGINE. The production evaluator is the pinned Go
//     toolchain adapter. "Interpreted" in the Bash++ plan means that the
//     Bash++ shell interpreter dispatches the typed node; it does not promise
//     an unsafe in-process Go interpreter.

// bashPPCapability classifies an import path by what an evaluator can actually
// do with it. Classification is derived from `go list -json` facts, never from
// the import path's spelling.
type bashPPCapability int

const (
	// capUnknown is the zero value and is deliberately first: an
	// unclassified package must refuse, not execute.
	capUnknown bashPPCapability = iota
	// capReviewedStdlib is in the reviewed pure-Go standard-library
	// inventory and may run through the reviewed toolchain adapter.
	capReviewedStdlib
	// capExternalPureGo is pure Go and buildable outside the standard
	// library: local-module, workspace, vendor and GOPATH packages land here.
	capExternalPureGo
	// capCgo requires cgo.
	capCgo
	// capCompiledOnly has no Go source available to build.
	capCompiledOnly
	// capNotBuildable is `package main`, a package with no buildable Go
	// files, or one excluded by build constraints on this platform.
	capNotBuildable
	// capUnreviewedStdlib is a standard-library package outside the
	// reviewed Go 1.27 inventory. It is refused rather than run: the
	// reviewed inventory is an allow-list, and quietly widening it to
	// "anything go list calls standard" would defeat the review.
	capUnreviewedStdlib
	// capMissing could not be resolved at all.
