// The one internal bounded Go-channel process line substrate, shared by the
// dialect's live-process surface (B14 `start(...)`) and available to any other
// consumer that needs to stream a process's stdout as lines. It exists once so
// there is a single place where the hard parts are settled:
//
//   - THE PRODUCER OWNS CLOSE. Exactly one goroutine writes to the lines
//     channel and it is the only thing that closes it, when the process's
//     stdout reaches EOF or streaming stops. A consumer never closes the
//     channel, so a range over Lines() terminates cleanly and there is no
//     send-on-closed race.
//
//   - ERRORS STAY SEPARATE FROM DATA. A line is a line; a scanner/IO failure
//     or a cancellation is reported through Wait's error result, never smuggled
//     in as a data line. The process's own exit status (including a non-zero
//     code or a signal) is a STATUS, returned as the first result of Wait, not
//     an error — so `set -e`-style logic and "did it fail" are the caller's to
//     decide, exactly as with `run`/`capture`.
//
//   - EVERY PROCESS IS DRAINED AND REAPED. stdout and stderr are both drained
//     to completion — even when the consumer stops reading early — so the child
//     never blocks on a full pipe, and the underlying process is Wait'd exactly
//     once so it is reaped rather than left a zombie. This is what keeps a
//     partial consumer or a cancellation from leaking a goroutine or a process.
//
//   - THE CHANNEL IS BOUNDED. Its capacity is fixed at construction, so a slow
//     consumer applies backpressure to the producer instead of letting an
//     unbounded queue grow without limit.
//
//   - NOTHING BUT WAIT BLOCKS. Lines() just hands back the channel and Stderr()
//     returns already-drained bytes; neither waits. Wait is the one blocking
//     call, and it is exact-once: repeated calls return the identical
//     (status, error) and reap the process only the first time.

// bashPPProcessSource is a process that has already been started, with its
// output streams available and a way to reap and to terminate it. Abstracting
// it this way lets the same substrate stream a real os/exec process (the
// ported os/exec lifecycle tests) and the dialect's in-process subshell (the
// `start(...)` surface) without duplicating the channel/drain/reap logic.
