// A JobCarrier supplies kernel-visible stand-in processes ("carriers")
// for background jobs. This interpreter runs asynchronous lists
// (`cmd &`) as goroutines rather than forked shells, so a job made only
// of builtins or compound commands has no OS process of its own and
// `$!` falls back to the opaque "g<N>" handle. A host that needs strict
// POSIX process semantics — every `$!` a real, signalable kernel PID —
// opts in with [WithJobCarrier]; see that option for the semantics.
//
// Implementations should launch a process that blocks until killed or
// told to exit. Tying the carrier's stdin to a pipe held by the host is
// a good pattern: the carrier exits on EOF, so it cannot outlive a host
// that dies without cleaning up. Hosts that enable job control
// (`set -m`) should also place each carrier in its own process group,
// because group-directed signals target the negated PID.

// is still running. Hosts implementing this extension let the runner react to

// WithJobCarrier gives background jobs a kernel-visible identity. For
// each asynchronous list (`cmd &`, including `a | b &`) the runner
// starts one carrier process via c and uses its real PID instead of the
// synthetic "g<N>" handle. That identity is stable for the job's lifetime:
// external children remain implementation details, and signals sent to `$!`
// enter through the carrier's relay and wait-status machinery.
//
// The carrier is a signal proxy, not the job itself. A signal that
// terminates the carrier is relayed to the job according to the job's
// own disposition for that signal at that moment, like a signal
// arriving at a real shell child:
//
//   - Trapped (a non-empty `trap` action, set inside the async list or
//     inherited from the parent shell): the signal is queued into the
//     job's pending-signal machinery and the trap action runs at the
//     job's next statement boundary. The action decides the job's fate —
//     it may `exit`, or return and leave the job running. This works
//     even for a signal relayed before the job has started running.
//   - Ignored (`trap ” SIG`, a signal hard-ignored at shell startup, or
//     SIGINT/SIGQUIT's default ignore in an asynchronous list without
//     job control): the job keeps running, unaffected.
//   - Default — and always for the uncatchable SIGKILL and SIGSTOP —
//     the signal terminates the job: the runner cancels the job's
//     context (killing any external child it is currently running) and
//     the job's exit status becomes 128+signal (e.g. 143 for SIGTERM,
//     137 for SIGKILL), matching a real shell child.
//
// A basic JobCarrier keeps its default dispositions: external `kill` decides
// the job's fate by killing the carrier, and the relay above happens when the
// runner reaps it. An IgnoredSignalJobCarrier may instead preserve the
// dispositions ignored when the background runner starts, keeping carrier
// identity for those signals. A disposition changed later by the job can
// still outlive a dead carrier; `wait` and `jobs` continue to resolve it.
// When the job finishes first, the runner reaps the carrier via
// [CarrierProcess.Terminate] and waits for its [CarrierProcess.Wait] to
// return before sealing the exit status, so a racing external kill
// either lands fully or is cleanly ignored, and by the time `wait`
// unblocks the carrier PID is truly gone — a following `kill -0 $!` sees
// no such process rather than a lingering carrier. PIDs of external
// processes the job spawns are still recorded, so `wait`/`kill` on those
// also resolve to the job.
//
// Opting in is a strict contract: the runner never falls back to a
// synthetic identity. If StartCarrier fails, or hands back a carrier
// with a nonpositive PID, the job is not started at all — the runner
// prints a diagnostic to stderr and the asynchronous statement fails
// with exit status 1, like a shell whose fork failed; `$!` keeps its
// previous value. Embedders that do not opt in keep the opaque "g<N>"
// handles and cannot claim strict process semantics for `$!`. Coprocs
// keep their existing synthetic `<NAME>_PID` and process substitutions
// are not jobs; neither uses a carrier. The option is ignored under
// `set -o dryrun` and in deterministic mode, which must not observe
// real PIDs.
//
// With a carrier configured, [WithBgPidCallback] fires once per
// background job with the carrier PID, rather than once per external
// process the job spawns.
