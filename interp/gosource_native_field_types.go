// Static types for the fields of a dependency-owned struct. The interpreter's
// own field tables describe only the types this program declares, so a static
// walk that reaches an imported struct has had no answer to give. That gap was
// invisible while the chain was a plain selector path off a name, because the
// runtime walker reads the handle instead; a chain that crosses a map index or
// a call has no such walker to fall back on.
