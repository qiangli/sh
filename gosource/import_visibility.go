// IdentityImporter is the policy-free half of a fallback importer. The
// explicit package map declares the identity of every package it checks —
// PackageSpec.Path for a mapped package, Options.ImportPath for the program,
// the compiler's -p — and decides internal visibility on that identity
// (syntax.BashPPInternalImportVisible) before consulting the fallback. A
// fallback that implements this interface is then asked to resolve the path
// for that identity WITHOUT applying a directory-derived visibility rule of
// its own: the decision was already taken on the declared identity, and a
// directory rule keyed on where the files happen to sit (a scratch
// directory, a symlink-mirrored GOROOT) would refuse what the identity
// admits. srcDir is the importing file's directory exactly as go/types
// supplies it to ImporterFrom.
//
// A fallback that does not implement it is used through types.ImporterFrom
// as before, with whatever policy it carries; the map's refusal always comes
// first, so the negative decisions do not depend on the fallback.
//
// Programs without a declared identity — no Options.ImportPath — never reach
// this interface: their imports go through the fallback's own rule
// unchanged, so an ordinary program on disk behaves exactly as before.
