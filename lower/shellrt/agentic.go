// This file carries the Bash++ agentic assistance contract (see
// docs/bashpp-agentic.md) for generated programs. The contract is a source
// opt-in: an explicit block permits assistance for the statements it encloses,
// and a marked callable requires an agentic caller. Nothing here selects a
// model, opens a network connection, spends anything, or grants a permission.
//
// The state is an explicit immutable value threaded through generated code.
// There is deliberately no goroutine identity, no thread-local, and no mutable
// package-level assistance scope: a copied Frame is an independent observation,
// which is what makes subshells, pipelines, tasks and deferred calls safe
// without any save/restore bookkeeping.

// Frame is the immutable agentic state of one execution region. The zero Frame
// has assistance off, so a region that never opted in cannot accidentally
// inherit it. Every transition returns a new Frame; no method mutates its
// receiver, and a Frame may be copied across goroutines.

// generated code states the rule it is applying.

// boolean. The boolean comes from the compiled source alone; no environment
// variable, flag or ambient runtime state supplies it.

// Callback returns the entry frame of a trap callback, including signal traps,
// and of a mapfile/readarray -C callback. Callbacks start with assistance off
// and may opt in with their own explicit block; the interrupted caller keeps
// its own frame, which is simply the value it never handed over.

// start with assistance off regardless of the frame that reached them.

// in this frame. It is the observation a cooperating in-process tool reads; it
// does not imply that any request will be made.

// Block returns the frame for the statements of an explicit agentic block. The
// block runs in the current shell, creates no variable scope, and opts in
// unconditionally, so the enclosing frame does not affect the result.
func (f Frame) Block() Frame { return Frame{on: true} }

// Eval returns the frame for eval'd text, which uses its current frame.
func (f Frame) Eval() Frame { return f }

// Child returns the independent copy taken by a subshell, pipeline element or
// task. The copy is independent because Frame is immutable: nothing the child
// does can be observed by the parent frame.

// Enter is the callable entry check, and is the whole of the "requires an
// agentic caller" rule. Generated code must call it before emitting any of the
// callable's body: a marked callable reached from a frame with assistance off
// fails here, and its body never runs.
//
// marked is the callable's declaration marker, resolved by the compiler. The
// returned body frame is derived from the declaration, not inherited from the
// caller: an ordinary helper or closure called inside an agentic block runs
// with assistance off until it enters its own explicit block.
